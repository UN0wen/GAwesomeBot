# GAwesomeBot

*Welcome to GAwesomeBot. The community revival of AwesomeBot! This repo will be mostly focused on bug fixes rather than any sort of new features (including music, get out if you're searching for that).*
The newest code in this repo will always be runned by [GAwesomeBot](https://bot.gilbertgobbels.xyz:8008)

## Contributing
Contributions are always appreciated, however, we use a special branching module to keep in mind when creating PR's. For example, any PR's pointing at the master branch will be deleted or edited to point at the development branch instead. If you want to create a PR about a new feature that is currently being worked on, say, music, point it to the right feature branch. Most likely called feature-music, or something among those lines. Want to learn more about our branch module? It's heavily inspired by http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.
